Python Archive

Want to store all my python learning files here for reference and future projects.
Most of the code will be directly from Codecademy.com or Google Code School.

For those interested, I listen to my Daft Punk Pandora station when coding as it pairs with tech,
for me, the same way a full bodied red pairs with a sirloin steak.
